# It is Day 24 of 100DaysOfCode with CodeWithHarry
# Tuples [Tuples are non changeable]

tup = (1, 5, 6)
print(type(tup), tup)

# There is a confusion in Python Developers mentioned below
tup2 = (1)
print(type(tup2))  # The output will be an type int ( to avoid this mistake we can add a comma if we are crearing single element typle like below)
tup3 = (1,)
print(type(tup3))  # This will print a type tuple ðŸ˜‡

# Tuples are behave like the same as lists in python but tuples are non changeable and starts with a () bracket notation
