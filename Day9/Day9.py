# Day 9 - Typecasting in Python

a = "1"
b = "2"

print(a+b)  # This will print 12 not 3 because both of the variables have the string value not the integers

# Here Typecasting comes to convert the string into numbers like â¬‡

print(int(a)+int(b))  # This will print 3

# Two types of Typecasting

# 1 Explicit Typecasting
# 2 Implicit Typecasting
