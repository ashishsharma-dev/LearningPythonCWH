# It is Day 36 of 100DaysOfCode with CodeWithHarry
# Exception Handling / Error Handling in python

# Lets take a test case here
# We want to print table of a number and we only want an integer from the user to print the table of the given integer
# What if the user types a string or another data type ðŸ˜• then our code will stop executing further
# That is the reason we use try and except here for the exception handling

tableOf = int(input("Enter the number: "))

print(f"The table of {tableOf} is printed below:")

try:
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{tableOf} X {i} = {tableOf*i}")
except ValueError:
    raise ValueError("Your custom message here.")

print("Here some lines of important code")
